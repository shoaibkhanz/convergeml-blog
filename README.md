# ConvergeML

Welcome to ConvergeML! This repository is dedicated to building a static website using MkDocs Material, where I aim to share my journey and insights as a Machine Learning (ML) engineer.

As an ML engineer, I am constantly learning and exploring new concepts, techniques, and tools in the field of machine learning. This website serves as a platform to document and share my learning experiences, projects, and tutorials with the community. Whether you're a fellow ML enthusiast or just starting out, I hope you find the content here informative and inspiring.
