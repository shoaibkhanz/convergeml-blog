# Welcome to ConvergeML

Thank you for visiting ConvergeML, a space dedicated to exploring and demystifying the complex world of machine learning. Here, I document my learnings and insights as I work through the full lifecycle of ML models, from defining use cases and understanding deployment considerations to testing, refining, interpreting, and monitoring models.

In machine learning, one principle remains clear: **"All models are wrong, but some are useful."** This quote from statistician George Box reminds us that models, while inherently simplified representations of reality, have the potential to unlock valuable insights and support impactful decisions. At ConvergeML, I approach model building with this in mind—starting from the use case, carefully considering how models fit into broader systems, and making deliberate choices about which assumptions to make.

Once data is in hand, **the real value often lies in feature engineering**—transforming, selecting, and crafting features that bring out the meaningful patterns within the data. This process goes beyond the idea that "data is the new oil" to a more refined focus on shaping the data in ways that maximize a model's interpretability and predictive power. Here, I aim to highlight the importance of this step, demonstrating techniques to improve both model performance and clarity.

Another key aspect of ConvergeML is building foundational understanding by **implementing things from scratch**. By constructing algorithms and models from the ground up, I hope to achieve a deeper grasp of each component’s function and behavior. Much like a mathematician testing assumptions, I believe in poking models and testing their behavior. This hands-on approach not only strengthens my understanding but also reveals insights into how models can be refined to handle a range of scenarios effectively.

I hope the content here serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning, experimenting, and advancing their understanding of machine learning. ConvergeML is built for those who, like me, believe that machine learning is not just about building models but about developing a solid foundation in the principles that drive them.

Welcome to ConvergeML—an evolving journey of discovery in AI.
